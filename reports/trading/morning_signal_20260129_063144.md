## EXECUTION STRATEGY

1.  **POSITION**: SELL DE-Peak (next 168h) small size.
2.  **RATIONALE**: CSS is deeply negative across all buckets, with peak still €10/MWh below CCGT marginal cost, indicating structural oversupply or weak demand.
3.  **RISK**: Low confidence mode and high volatility could lead to sharp price spikes; monitor demand/supply balance for sudden shifts and be ready to cover above €90/MWh.

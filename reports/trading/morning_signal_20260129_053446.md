## EXECUTION STRATEGY

1.  **POSITION**: SELL peak, small to medium size.
2.  **RATIONALE**: All CSS are deeply negative, with `peak` being the least unprofitable. This implies significant oversupply and strong resistance for prices to rise above CCGT marginal cost.
3.  **RISK**: Monitor for sudden demand spikes or unexpected generation outages. If prices approach €90/MWh in peak, be ready to cover or reduce short.
